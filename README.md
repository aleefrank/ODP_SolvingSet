# ODPSolvingSet_Project

One of the great things about the Julia programming language is that it is very easy to manage the dependencies of your project.
In short, two files Project.toml and Manifest.toml uniquely specify what packages and in what versions are required by your scripts.

If not specified otherwise, Julia is started in a default (global) environment.

In order to run the ODPSolvingSet algorithm follow the following steps:
1_ Start a new Julia session and, in the Julia REPL, press "]"" to switch to package manager mode.
2_ activate the ODPSolvingSet_Project environment, by typing:
      julia> activate "ODPSolvingSet folder path
      In this way, all dependencies will be read from Project.toml and Manifest.toml
2_ run "Main.jl"
